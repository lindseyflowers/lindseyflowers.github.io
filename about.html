    <h2> Growing </h2>
    <p> I was born an army brat but raised a Northern Virginia native. Before settling in Alexandria, VA we lived in the southern U.S. and Italy (no, I'm not fluent; yes, the gelato was amazing). </p>
    <p> Everytime I look in the mirror I look a little more like my mom and everytime I speak I sound a little more like my dad. I try to encompass the best parts of both of them: my mom's ability to fight through trying times, and my dad's persistency in doing what's right. </p>
    <p> I've been very priveled growing up, both with the location and my support system. I'm going to use these rooots to continue growing, becoming a person who fights for what she believes in and does whatever it takes to get there, no matter the obstacles. </p>

  <h2> Learning </h2>
  <p> I'm a public relations major and professional writing and social change + leadership minor at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia. I want to use my degree to do some good in the world, whether it be at a non-profit, community-minded organization or government agency. Public relations combines my love of communication, the written word and fostering meaningful relationships perfectly. </p>

  <p> Now that I finally have some direction and have found what I am passionate about, I am working to be able to use my degree to improve other’s lives. My formal schooling may almost be complete, but I'm far from done learning: I'm going to continue learning how to use best serve my community with the skillset my education has provided.</p>

<div class="col-sm-4">
  <h2> Thriving </h2>
<p> I believe in getting the most out of every day—in doing more than merely existing. </p>
<p> My time at Virginia Tech has given me purpose.  It was through living here that I discovered my love of hiking, of the outdoors and of dancing like nobody is watching. I've realized that my time is what I make of it, and I want to spend it helping others, being unafraid of new possibilities and embracing my individuality.  </p>

<p>Because of it, I no longer feel content to just exist. I may not know exactly what I want to do, but I know I want to make other’s lives better. I push myself to do things that matter, to pick a career where I will thrive, to help others, and be happy with my own existence.</p>
